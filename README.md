# pyHerofromhome

This project is a clone of the popular game, Guitar Hero. I created it individually as part of a Grade 12 cummulative project with Python 3, in PyCharm, using the PyGame module. I am only aware of being able to run the program in Pycharm Community Edition, and ensuring that PyGame is properly configured after opening the project. The levelCreator file was used to create txt files containing the timing for when each note should drop, including the note color. The musicPlayer file contains a function that takes the input song and reads all the notes for that song and puts all their info into an array. The main file ultimately runs the game and uses the PyGame module for the interactive display.

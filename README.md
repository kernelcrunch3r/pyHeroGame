# pyHerofromhome

This project is a clone of the popular game, Guitar Hero. I created it individually as part of a Grade 12 cummulative project with Python 3, in PyCharm,
using the PyGame module. I am only aware of being able to run the program in Pycharm Community Edition, and ensuring that PyGame is properly configured
after opening the project.
